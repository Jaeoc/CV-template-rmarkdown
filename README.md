# CV template - PDF from rmarkdown
This is a more generic version of own CV (available at [olssoncollentine.com/files/cv.pdf](olssoncollentine.com/files/cv.pdf)) which can be used as a template.

It is adapted from Steven Miller's template: http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/

The main difference from Steven Miller's version is that I:

1) Do all my formatting via R-code instead of manually 
2) Use slightly different formatting

That is, I use knitr tables to format my output rather than writing manual markdown and latex for each data point in the R-markdown file.

For the filler data in the template I mainly copied from Steven Miller's  William Sealy Gosset CV, but some datapoints are just made up.
